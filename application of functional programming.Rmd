## Load a couple libraries
```{r, message=F}
library(tidyverse) 
library(glue) # similar to paste() but more powerful
```

All of the ideas in this talk come from other people, primarily the *R for Data Science* iteration chapter.


https://r4ds.had.co.nz/iteration.html


## R lets you create tools that work the way you want them to

For example you can define a new ifelse function that treats NA like any other value.

```{r}
ifelse2 <- function(test, yes, no) ifelse(!is.na(test) & test, yes, no)

tibble(age = c(0, NA, 5, 15, 21, 35)) %>% 
  mutate(ifelse  =  ifelse(age < 18, "Minor", "Adult"),  # Base R version
         ifelse2 = ifelse2(age < 18, "Minor", "Adult"),  # My custom version
         if_else = if_else(age < 18, "Minor", "Adult"))  # Tidyverse version
```


## The tidyverse developers have re-implemented a lot of base R functionality

if_else has an argument for explicit NA handling

```{r}
tibble(age = c(0, NA, 5, 15, 21, 35)) %>% 
  mutate(ifelse  =  ifelse(age < 18, "Minor", "Adult"),
         ifelse2 = ifelse2(age < 18, "Minor", "Adult"),  
         if_else = if_else(age < 18, "Minor", "Adult", missing = "We don't know"))

```



## Strangely, case_when treats NA like any other value

```{r}
tibble(age = c(0, NA, 5, 15, 21, 35)) %>% 
  mutate(case_when = case_when(
    age < 1 ~ "Baby",     
    age < 18 ~ "Minor",
    T ~ "Adult"))

tibble(age = c(0, NA, 5, 15, 21, 35)) %>% 
  mutate(case_when = case_when(
    age < 1 ~ "Baby",     
    age < 18 ~ "Minor",
    is.na(age) ~ "We don't know",
    T ~ "Adult"))
```


## The tidyverse functions tend to be more strict than base R

```{r, error=T}
ifelse(1:6 > 3, ">3", c("less", "than 3"))
ifelse(1:6 > 3, ">3", 4)
if_else(1:6 > 3, ">3", c("less", "than 3"))
if_else(1:6 > 3, ">3", 4)
```

## However this strictness has consequences

```{r, error=T}
if_else(1:6 > 3, ">3", NA)
typeof(NA)
if_else(1:6 > 3, ">3", NA_character_)
```


## There are lots of convenience functions in the tidyverse

`complete()` makes implicit missing values explicit by filling in missing combinations.

```{r}

tibble(patkey = 1:3, visit_number = 1:3) %>% 
  complete(patkey, visit_number)

```




## Create some fake visit data

Creating fake data is really helpful for creating a reproducible example (aka reprex)

```{r}
npats <- 100
nvisits <- 10
create_visit_df <- function(visit_number) {
  tibble(
    patid  = 1:npats,
    visitdate = lubridate::as_date(sample(0:1e4, 100)),
    blooddraw = rbinom(npats, 1, prob = .7),
    bloodrawwho_nurse = blooddraw*rbinom(npats, 1, prob = .7),
    bloodrawwho_other = blooddraw*(1-bloodrawwho_nurse)
  ) %>% 
    rename_at(vars(-patid), ~paste0(., "_", visit_number))
}

visit_wide <- map(1:nvisits, create_visit_df) %>% 
  reduce(inner_join, by = "patid")

```


## One row per patient with grouped columns

```{r, echo=F, out.width=20}
DT::datatable(visit_wide)
# visit_wide
```

## The goal: One row per visit
```{r, echo=F, out.width=2}
# the echo=F chunk option supresses printing of the code to the slide. The code still runs and the output is inlcuded though.

map(1:nvisits, ~select(visit_wide, patid, ends_with(glue("_{.}")))) %>% 
  map_dfr(~rename_all(., ~str_remove(., "_[:digit:]+$"))) %>% 
  arrange(patid) #%>% 
  # DT::datatable()

```

## Visually...

```{r, out.width = "1000px", echo=F}
knitr::include_graphics("grouped_transposition.gif")
```


## Lists

In computer science, a list or sequence is an abstract data type that represents a countable number of ordered values, where the same value may occur more than once.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_(abstract_data_type)

Basically it is just a container.

## Lists can contain anything

```{r}

random_stuff <- list(mtcars,
                     qplot(mpg, cyl, data = mtcars), 
                     function(x) x^2, 
                     list("a", "b", "c"))
str(random_stuff, max.level = 1)
```

More complex objects in R are often just lists.

## Lists that contain objects of one type are especially useful

```{r}
list(1:3, 4:10, seq(0, 20, by = 2))
```


## Apply a function to each element of a list

Put the output of the element in a new list

```{r}
numeric_list <- list(1:3, 4:10, seq(0, 20, by = 2))

map(numeric_list, sum)

```

## Apply a custom function

```{r}
numeric_list <- list(1:3, 4:10, seq(0, 20, by = 2))

L2norm <- function(x) sqrt(sum(x^2))

map(numeric_list, L2norm)

```


## Create a custom function on the fly

Also called an anonymous function since it has no name

```{r}
numeric_list <- list(1:3, 4:10, seq(0, 20, by = 2))

map(numeric_list, function(x) sqrt(sum(x^2)))

```

## Use the ~ . shortcut to create a custom function on the fly

This shortcut only works in the tidyverse.

```{r}
numeric_list <- list(1:3, 4:10, seq(0, 20, by = 2))

map(numeric_list, ~sqrt(sum(.^2)))

```

## Reduce a list to a single value

Use a function that takes two arguments and returns one value to reduce a list.

`+` is such a function 

```{r}
numeric_list <- list(1:3, 4:10, seq(0, 20, by = 2))

map(numeric_list, ~sqrt(sum(.^2))) %>% 
  reduce(`+`)

```


## Another example using glue for string concatenation

Anything inside {} is evaluated as code

```{r}
map(1:3, ~glue("_{.}")) %>% 
  reduce(c)
```


## Variants of map will do the reduce step for us

`map_chr` returns a character vector.

There are many other variants of the map function.

```{r}
map_chr(1:3, ~glue("_{.}")) 
```


## And just for the fun of it...


```{r, out.width = "1000px", echo=F}
# ![](animation.gif)
knitr::include_graphics("map_reduce_animation.gif")
```


## Back to the problem at hand

We can easily select all variables for one visit

```{r}
select(visit_wide, patid, ends_with("_1"))
```

```{r}

```



## Split the dataframe into a list of dataframes

```{r}
df_list <- map(1:nvisits, ~select(visit_wide, patid, ends_with(glue("_{.}"))))

str(df_list, max.level = 1)
```

## The first visit

```{r}
df_list[[1]]
```

## The second visit

```{r}
df_list[[2]]
```

## We need to rename the columns

```{r}
df_list2 <- map(df_list, ~rename_all(., ~str_remove(., "_[:digit:]+$")))

map(df_list2, names)
```

## Finally we reduce using bind_rows

bind_rows takes two dataframes and rowbinds them
reducing the list with bindrows will iteratively apply bind_rows so we end up with one dataframe

```{r}
reduce(df_list2, bind_rows)
```

## Using the pipe %>% we can do all this three lines

```{r}
map(1:nvisits, ~select(visit_wide, patid, ends_with(glue("_{.}")))) %>% 
  map(~rename_all(., ~str_remove(., "_[:digit:]+$"))) %>% 
  reduce(bind_rows)

```

## And since bind_rows will accept a list we don't even need reduce in this example

```{r}
map(1:nvisits, ~select(visit_wide, patid, ends_with(glue("_{.}")))) %>% 
  map(~rename_all(., ~str_remove(., "_[:digit:]+$"))) %>% 
  bind_rows()

```


## Using the map_dfr variant we can do it in two lines

```{r}
map(1:nvisits, ~select(visit_wide, patid, ends_with(glue("_{.}")))) %>% 
  map_dfr(~rename_all(., ~str_remove(., "_[:digit:]+$"))) 

```


## Add a visit number column

map2 is similar to map but loops over two arguments .x and .y in parallel.

In this case we are looping over our datafame list and the numbers 1 to `r nvisits`.

```{r}

map(1:nvisits, ~select(visit_wide, patid, ends_with(glue("_{.}")))) %>% 
  map2(1:nvisits, ~mutate(.x, visit_number = .y)) %>% 
  map_dfr(~rename_all(., ~str_remove(., "_[:digit:]+$"))) 


```


## It even works with a database

Create a SQLite database in memory and load our visit data into it

```{r}
library(DBI)
con <- dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(), ":memory:")
dbWriteTable(con, "visit_wide", visit_wide)
visit_db <- tbl(con, "visit_wide")
```


## R writes the SQL for us and sends it to the database

We just change bind_rows to union_all


```{r}
map(1:nvisits, ~select(visit_db, patid, ends_with(glue("_{.}")))) %>% 
  map(~rename_all(., ~str_remove(., "_[:digit:]+$"))) %>% 
  reduce(union_all)
```

## map saved us from having to write a lot of SQL

```{r}

map(1:nvisits, ~select(visit_db, patid, ends_with(glue("_{.}")))) %>% 
  map(~rename_all(., ~str_remove(., "_[:digit:]+$"))) %>% 
  reduce(union_all) %>% 
  show_query()
```

## The main takeaway

The map and reduce functions allow us to program on a higher level of abstraction. As the number of visits increases SQL requires more code while the R code does not need to change. `map` and `reduce` basically just write `for` loops for you.

We can think of the scoped variants of dplyr in much the same way.

```{r, eval = F}
mutate_if(); mutate_at(); mutate_all()
select_if(); select_at(); select_all()
filter_if(); filter_at(); filter_all()
rename_if(); rename_at(); rename_all()
summarise_if(); summarise_at(); summarise_all()
```

These functions map over a dataframe which is a list of columns.


## Extensions: Functions as data

```{r}
lst(min, mean, median, max, sd) %>% 
  map_dfr(~map(mtcars, .), .id = "summary")

```

This works because a dataframe is a list. It is a list of columns.

```{r}
is.list(mtcars)
```



## Extensions: List-columns in a dataframe


Since list can contain other lists we can put anything inside a dataframe as a list column.

Here we split the mtcars dataframe by the cyl variable and fit a linear model to each subset. Then we pull out the $R^2$ value from each model.

```{r}
model_df <- mtcars %>% 
  nest(data = -cyl) %>% 
  mutate(model = map(data, ~lm(mpg ~ ., data = .))) %>% 
  mutate(r_squared = map_dbl(model, ~summary(.)$r.squared))

model_df
```


## Extensions: Many models idea from R4ds

We can permanently save all our models and data in a single object.

```{r, eval=F}
write_rds(model_df, "model_df.rds")
```


The dataframe then becomes a more general data structure to store like objects together on a single row. Not every problem or analysis should be fit into this framework but it is a powerful concept that applies to many problems analysts face.

## Could this transposition have been done with pivot_longer() or gather()?

I don't think so since `pivot_longer` and `gather` take many columns and collapse then into one column. Here we have columns of different types that can't easily be put into a single column. I could be wrong though!

```{r, error=T}

visit_wide %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = -patid)

```



```{r, include=F}
dbDisconnect(con)
```
